#Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset)

The goal of this report is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set

#Preprocessing

The first step is to download and read the data.


```r
if(!file.exists("training.csv")){ download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", "training.csv", mode = "wb")
}
if(!file.exists("testing.csv")){ download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", "testing.csv", mode = "wb")
}
training <- read.csv("training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("testing.csv")
```

After, we remove the columns with NA values from the training data set.


```r
na <- colSums(is.na(training))
training <- training[,na == 0]
```

Then we remove the variables with near zero variance.


```r
library(caret)
```

```
## Loading required package: lattice
```

```
## Loading required package: ggplot2
```

```r
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[,-nzv]
```

Later, we remove the identification variables because they aren't usable as predictors (first five columns).


```r
training <- training[,-(1:5)]
```

And finally, we proceed to sub-sample the training set into a smaller training set and new test set.


```r
set.seed(1995)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = training$classe, p = 0.6, list = FALSE)
train_set <- training[inTrain, ]
test_set <- training[-inTrain,]
dim(train_set)
```

```
## [1] 11776    54
```

```r
dim(test_set)
```

```
## [1] 7846   54
```

```r
library(ggplot2)
qplot(train_set$classe, main = "Classes", xlab = "Classes", fill = train_set$classe)+theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#Model Building

We'll build two models a classification tree and a random forest, the final model will be the one with the highest accuracy.

## Classification Tree

```r
library(rpart)
ctm <- rpart(classe~., data = train_set, method = "class")
ctmp <- predict(ctm, newdata = test_set, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(ctmp, test_set$classe)
```

```

#Model Selection & Out of sample Error

Our definitive model is the Random Forest Model (0.9962) which has the highest accuracy, in comparison with the classification tree model (0.7266)

```r
rfm$finalModel
```

```
## 
## Call:
##  randomForest(x = x, y = y, mtry = param$mtry) 
##                Type of random forest: classification
##                      Number of trees: 500
## No. of variables tried at each split: 27
## 
##         OOB estimate of  error rate: 0.35%
## Confusion matrix:
##      A    B    C    D    E class.error
## A 3348    0    0    0    0 0.000000000
## B    8 2266    4    1    0 0.005704256
## C    0    7 2047    0    0 0.003407984
## D    0    0   14 1915    1 0.007772021
## E    0    1    0    5 2159 0.002771363
```
As we can see the Out of sample error is of 0.35%.
